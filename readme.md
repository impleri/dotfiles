# Random Dotfiles

I use a number of different computers, so having a single place to store
my more common config files was a good idea. These files are dereferenced
from my own specific configuration (e.g. file paths, passwords, etc) so
that others can feel free to implement these as well.

## Installation

```sh
  mkdir ~/workspace
  cd ~/workspace
  git clone git@github.com:impleri/dotfiles.git
  cd dotfiles
  ./install.sh
```
